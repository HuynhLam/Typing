Your prowess with a lightsaber is childish vanity. 
Your physical Force powers are no more than a conjurer’s trick, 
sleight of hand to dazzle the ordinary beings you should be serving. 
You profane these powers by using them as weapons in war. 
And you fail to grasp the single, simple, uncompromising duty of 
the true Jedi. The Jedi is the rock-lion at the gate who says, 
“I will defend these beings with my life, and that is the sum of me.” 
Etain Tur-Mukan died to save one life, a man she did not even know, 
but felt compelled to save, and that is what made her stronger in 
the Force and a truer Jedi than any of you acrobats, tricksters, 
and specious, empty philosophers.
